## `ss2`

"Subreddit Scraper 2", presumably.
From Jan 10, 2021.

Requires a `credentials.py` file adjacent to `main.py` to run, containing Reddit API credentials. 
You will need to configure some settings in `main.py` as well.

Seems to extract video/photo/embed posts from subreddits in a list file.
